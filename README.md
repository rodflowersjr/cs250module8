### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I start off by analyzing the system. To do this, I ask the team for feedback and the client for any clarification of the product. User stories help with gathering information on the project as they allow each of the team members to discuss potential roadblocks and assess their capabilities.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I can approach developing programs by using either the waterfall method or the Agile method. I hope to incorporate Agile into my future projects. More specifically, I would like to implement daily meetings and user stories to develop transparency among my team.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member knows their strengths and weaknesses and is able to communicate these matters with the team. They are aware of their own limitations and are able to point out exactly what roadblocks they may have.
